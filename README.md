[![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/tlienart/JuDoc.jl/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/tlienart/JuDoc.jl?branch=master)


* check that everything "works"
    * fix bug with list element starting with some maths
* go through github issues and remove irrelevant ones
* add doc
    * `process_file` in `manager/file_utils.jl`
* add tests
    * definition of global latex commands via config
* add future issues
    * nesting of conditions in HTML setting
    * much more testing
    * (eventually) benchmarking, though should be quite quick
    * insert content that does also need to be processed? (e.g. html). it's unclear there's a usecase for this so maybe wait until there is one...
        * one parallel situation could be to insert the content of a code file
        and display it as such. This could be done within the markdown or, in fact could leak through by writing directly in the markdown `'''julia{{ insert path_to_code.jl}}'''` which would permeate through the html conversion then bring in the jl code and display it. (could also think about inserting CSV etc.)
    * css pre-processing (variables)

## Context project

* [x] find lxcommands with right number of braces early, mark as XBLOCK
* [x] add `:LX_COMS_*` in the xblocks.
* after get allblocks, reconstitute a partial MD plugging in stoppers at right place `##JD_INSERT##`
    * [x] rewrite an alternative get_allblocks which forms the intermediate md
    * [x] test it
    * **TODO** remove all calls to allblocks
* update `convert_md`
    * add `convert_md__plugblocks(...)`
    * `_procblock` qualify the arguments of the function
    * remove calls to `coms`, this impacts `resolve_latex` as well potentially
    need to think about this...
    * cleanup functions that are not used / have been replaced. Potential functions
        * `convert_md__procblock`
        * `resolve_latex`
        * resolve doc of `insert_proc_xblocks` + arguments
* parse the partial MD using base markdown parser, the stoppers will be at the right place
    * update `convert_md` to use `form_interm_md` and process stoppers appropriately
* tokenize the resulting partial HTML with the tokens `##JD_INSERT##` and process considering the matching `xblocks` (for each `##JD_INSERT##` there is a `xblock`)
    * read the partial HTML until the next token
    * resolve token
        * `##JD_INSERT##` --> resolve the block or resolve latex or resolve maths
        * `@@*` --> write the appropriate replacement
    * keep writing
* (after) remove redundancy of finding braces etc in `find_md_lxcoms` and also in `resolve_latex`. Maybe some parts need to be there still.


# JuDoc

## Getting started

must start with something like (the folders/files marked with a star *must* be there)

```
site
+-- libs (*)
|   +-- katex
|   +-- prism
+-- src (*)
|   +-- _css (*)
|   +-- _html_parts (*)
|   +-- pages (*)
|   |   +-- folder1 ...
|   |   +-- folder2 ...
|   +-- config.md
|   +-- index.md
+-- run_jdoc.jl (*)
```

where `run_jdoc.jl` is something like

```julia
using JuDoc
FOLDER_PATH = @__DIR__
judoc(single_pass=false)
```

this leads to (files/folders marked with a † are generated)

```
site
+-- css (†)
+-- libs
+-- pub (†)
|   +-- folder1 ...
|   +-- folder2 ...
+-- src
+-- index.html (†)
+-- run_jdoc.jl
```

### Todo

* Benchmark

**Exit**
* [ ] (low) in running script need

```julia
ccall(:jl_exit_on_sigint, Void, (Cint,), 0)
```

otherwise segfault on CTRL+C (outside of REPL). Should encourage doing stuff in the REPL (not like Hugo). For productionised version can have a small shell script or something that launches Julia with appropriate first few lines or something.

### Thoughts

* user needs to add their own `prism.css` to match the languages they want to highlight (current one is bash, julia, python, R, yaml)
* minify katex eventually. --> maybe production mode option, just use python `css-html-js-minify web_html/` which is great. Need to make sure all lib paths are done with `.min` though!
	* could have a final pass with some `{{}}` stuff. Probably also useful for things like equation numbers and hyper-references.

### Local simple web server installation (EXTERNAL)

```bash
npm install -g local-web-server
```

actually [this](https://medium.com/@svinkle/start-a-local-live-reload-web-server-with-one-command-72f99bc6e855) is even better with live reload.
It looks like it may be possible to do this with a combination of `WebSockets.jl` and `HTTP.jl` but haven't figured out how yet. Package `Pages.jl` may offer some (out of date) help.


## Design
