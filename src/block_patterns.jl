    BlockPat

A BlockPat object contains the information required to find a specific block
in a raw string as well as how to replace this block. The patterns are tuples
containing strings, one to determine how the block starts, the other how it
ends.

- fpat: a pattern describing how to find the block in the original string
- rpat: a pattern describing how to replace the block

Main case is asymetric where the block starts with a tag and ends with another.
In the symetric case, the offset (how long is the tag) is important to be able
to detect the block.
