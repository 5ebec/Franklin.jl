    Token <: AbstractBlock

A token `τ::Token` denotes the part of a main source string that we care about
and identified by a symbol `τ.name` (e.g.: `:MATH_ALIGN_OPEN`). Tokens are
typically used in this code to identify delimiters of environments.
See also `Block`, `LxBlock`.

    Block === Token

A `Block` has the same content as a `Token`, only the name indicates a segment
of text typically surrounded by an opening and a closing token. This synonym
helps the readability of the code to distinguish delimiters (tokens) from
segments (blocks).
See also `Token`, `LxBlock`.

Forward lookup checking if a sequence of characters matches `refstring` and

* whether there is an offset or not (if it is required to check a following
character or not)
