    Token

A token `τ::Token` denotes the part of a main source string that we care about
covering the range `τ.from:τ.to` and identified by a symbol `τ.name` (e.g.:
`:MATH_ALIGN_OPEN`). Tokens are typically used in this code to identify
delimiters of environments.

"""
    Block

A block has the same content as a token, only the name indicates a segment of
text typically surrounded by an opening and a closing token. This synonym helps
the readability of the code to distinguish delimiters (tokens) from segments
(blocks).

Forward lookup checking if a sequence of characters matches `refstring` and
