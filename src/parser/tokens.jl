    AbstractBlock

This is the supertype defining a section of the string into consideration which
can be considered as a "block". For instance, `abc { ... } def` contains one
"braces block" corresponding to the substring `{ ... }`.
All subtypes of AbstractBlock must have a `ss` field corresponding to the
substring associated to the block.

"""
    Token <: AbstractBlock

A token `τ::Token` denotes a part of the source string indicating a region that
may need further processing. It is identified by a symbol `τ.name` (e.g.:
`:MATH_ALIGN_OPEN`). Tokens are typically used in this code to identify
delimiters of environments.
For instance, `abc \$ ... \$ def` contains two tokens `:MATH_A` associated with
the `\$` sign. Together they delimit here an inline math expression.
See also `Block`, `LxBlock`.

"""
    Block === Token

A `Block` has the same content as a `Token`, only the name indicates a segment
of text typically surrounded by an opening and a closing token. This synonym
helps the readability of the code to distinguish delimiters (tokens) from
segments (blocks) even though they're effectively defined the same way.

Forward lookup checking if a sequence of characters matches `refstring` and
