    resolve_latex(str, bfrom, bto, ismaths, lxtokens, lxdefs, bblocks)

Consider a string `str` over a specfic range `str[bfrom, bto]` and resolve
any user-defined latex commands that may be in there. The parameter `ismaths`
helps track whether the current context is a math block or not. In a math block
unknown command should not raise an error and be fed to KaTeX which may be able
to deal with them or will raise an error itself. `lxtokens` is a list of tokens
corresponding to latex commands, `lxdefs` is the collection of user definitions
and `lxdefs_locs` keeps track of where (how early) things are defined (commands
cannot be used before they've been defined).
Once the definition of a found command is applied, a re-parsing is necessary
since the definition of the command may itself contain tokens.
The function returns the resulting string once all user-defined commands have
been appropriately replaced and processed.
