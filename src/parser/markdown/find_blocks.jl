    find_md_ocblocks(tokens, otoken, ctoken, deactivate)

Find active blocks between an opening token (`otoken`) and a closing token
`ctoken`. These can be nested (e.g. braces). Return the list of such blocks. If
`deactivate` is `true`, all the tokens within the block will be marked as
inactive (for further, separate processing).

Find blocks of text that will be extracted (see `MD_EXTRACT`, `MD_MATHS`).
Blocks are searched for in order, tokens that are contained in a extracted
block are deactivated (unless it's a maths block in which case latex tokens are
preserved). The function returns the list of blocks as well as a shrunken list
of active tokens. These blocks cannot be nested.
