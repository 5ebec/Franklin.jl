    judoc(;single_pass, clear_out_dir, verb)

Take a directory that contains markdown files (possibly in subfolders), convert
all markdown files to html and reproduce the same structure to an output dir.

* `single_pass` compiles the whole thing once (no dir watching).
* `clear_out_dir` destroys what was previously in `out_dir` this can be useful
if file names have been changed etc to get rid of stale files.
* `verb` whether to display things
